You: Write a short poem about programming

ü§ñ AI: 
# The Silent Symphony

In chambers of logic, fingers dance,
Across keys that speak in binary romance.
Functions bloom like flowers in spring,
Each line of code, a note that sings.

Bugs scatter like shadows from light,
As minds wrestle problems through the night.
In this world built of thought and will,
Time bends to those with craft and skill.

A universe created keystroke by keystroke,
Ideas once dreamed, now finally awoke.
```

### Getting coding help

```
$ python openrouter_chat.py --system coding

You: How do I create a simple HTTP server in Python?

ü§ñ AI: You can create a simple HTTP server in Python using the built-in `http.server` module. Here's how:

```python
# Simple HTTP Server in Python
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import socket

# Define server parameters
HOST_NAME = "localhost"
PORT = 8000

# Create the server
server = HTTPServer((HOST_NAME, PORT), SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)

print(f"Server started at http://{HOST_NAME}:{PORT}")

try:
    # Start the server
    server.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Handle Ctrl+C gracefully
    print("\nShutting down the server...")
    server.server_close()
    print("Server shut down successfully")
```

To use this:
1. Save it as `simple_server.py`
2. Run it with `python simple_server.py`
3. Access http://localhost:8000 in your browser
4. It will serve files from the current directory
5. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```
